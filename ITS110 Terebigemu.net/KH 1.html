	<p>The first game of the series features Sora, a boy that knew nothing but a sweet, dreamy life in a world named Destiny Islands. He and his childhood friends, Riku and Kairi would often joke about going to other worlds, but they never thought it could be reality. One night, a huge storm came to the island, and Sora was separated from his friends. Riku was seen getting swallowed up into darkness, and Kairi seems to disappear entirely. Sora is dragged into the raging winds of the storm, and is flung to another world, Traverse Town. There, he meets his new friends, Donald and Goofy. In this town, Leon and Aerith tell him that his job is to kill Heartless, and that if he wants to find his friends, Riku and Kairi, he must defeat all the Heartless and save all the worlds. As Sora fights these monsters and travels from world to world, he searches for his childhood friends, Riku and Kairi. <br></br>

	At the game's climax, Sora and his friend Riku have a massive battle over Kingdom Hearts, the heart-shaped moon that gathers all the souls of the Heartless that Sora defeats. After this battle, Sora sacrifices himself for Kairi, as Riku (under the possession of Ansem) nearly kills her. However, Kairi, being in love with Sora, brings his soul back from being a Heartless. Towards the very end of the game, the original world Sora was in, Destiny Islands, is seen in pieces (just as Sora had last seen it before being sent to Traverse Town) and it is dominated by powerful Heartless under the command of one called Ansem. Ansem, who also harbors the soul of Riku, fights Sora in hopes that he can end him and have all the power in the world. Sora nonetheless defeats him, which brings us to the next game in the franchise: <br></br><a href="KH 2.html">Kingdom Hearts 2.</a>
