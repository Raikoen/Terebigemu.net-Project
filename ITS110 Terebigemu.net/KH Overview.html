<center><div id="article">
	<p>Kingdom Hearts is a massive franchise created by Disney and Square Enix. Disney is known for their animated movies, and Square Enix is known for their video games. The two companies have worked together to create the Kingdom Hearts franchise for over the last 14 years since the first release of Kingdom Hearts for the PS2 in 2002.<br></br>
	
	As a whole, the Kingdom Hearts franchise tells a massive story centered around Sora, a boy who is chosen to wield a mysterious and powerful weapon called a Keyblade. Using this weapon, Sora fights monsters ranging from Heartless to Nobodies and even other video game characters from the other franchise that Square Enix is working on-Final Fantasy. Sora and his two friends, Donald and Goofy (from Disney) are charged with fighting these monsters to save the multiple worlds that are plagued by them. The hope, in theory (as the massive story isn't even OVER yet, Disney and Square Enix are still working on the last game of the series, Kingdom Hearts 3) is that after Sora defeats all the threats to the worlds and his friends, Riku and Kairi (Kingdom Hearts exlcusives), Kingdom Hearts (masssive heart-shaped moon that collects the souls of all the monsters Sora defeats) will be peaceful.
