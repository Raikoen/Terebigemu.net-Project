	<p>Kingdom Hearts 2 begins with a boy named Roxas. Roxas has a few dreams that feature events from Kingdom Hearts 1. He begins to wonder why he would be having someone else's memories as his dreams, and as he ponders the answer, monsters called Nobodies begin to come after him. The only weapon he can use to best these monsters is the Keyblade, the very weapon featured within his dreams that the dream boy (Sora) had used to defeat Heartless. Soon, Roxas discovers that his power to wield this mysterious Keyblade is only because he is a part of Sora, and not because Roxas himself is powerful. In fact, Roxas is not even supposed to exist in the first place. Roxas's prologue ends with Roxas standing outside a cocoon that Sora is sleeping in, and Roxas is seen disappearing into darkness. The very next scene features Sora waking from his slumber and reuniting with his friends, Donald and Goofy.<br></br>
	
	The merry trio continues their journey and searches for the King, Riku, and Kairi. Rumors abound that the King was last seen heading to his master, Master Yen Sid. The trio head to Yen Sid's castle and Sora is made aware of the state of the worlds. He is made aware that he must, once again, save all the worlds (some of them new to him) by defeating Heartless and a new enemy, the Nobodies and Organization XIII. He is told that if he wants to find his friends, Riku and Kairi, he must bring balance to the worlds again.<br></br>
	
	Towards the game's end, it is made apparent that Riku had been following Sora and helping him through his journey for a long time. It is also made apparent that Riku has been protecting Kairi as well, but Sora is not made aware of this until he reaches the last world, the World That Never Was. At the game's end, Sora and Riku team up against Xemnas, essentially the reincarnation of Ansem. They defeat him, and the game ends with Sora and Riku returning to their island, where Kairi, Donald, and Goofy await. However, the story doesn't end there. Kingdom Hearts 3 still needs to happen, and it's still in development. Who knows what will happen to the trio and the rest of the worlds now!
